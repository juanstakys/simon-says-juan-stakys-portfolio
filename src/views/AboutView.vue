    <h2 class="text-2xl">Background</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate programmer from Argentina, with a fervor for MATHS and LANGUAGE
      LEARNING. I've always been interested in technology and at 15 I started programming
      in C++. I engaged in Maths Olympiads at around the same age, until I finished
      secondary education. There, I discovered that I wanted to dedicate my life to
      technology and engineering, driven by my curiosity about the world and how it works
      and my enthusiasm for learning everyday and solving all kind of challenging
      problems. I'm also very interested in science, specially physics and astronomy. I
      enjoy facing problems with a logical perspective: that was always my greatest
      strenght. In those years, I met several friends with the same interests as mine and
      that helped me develop my skills and knowledge faster.

      Immediately after finishing secondary school, I started working as a Software
      Developer at a consultant company in my country with clients all around Latin
      America. Beyond science and technology, I have a humanistic side. I love learning
      languages and I'm always looking for new ones to learn. I speak native Spanish and
      fluent English. In my teens I've worked as a tutor for my classmates and people that
      needed help for school. I have also developed a strong interest in linguistics and
      philosophy. Nowadays I'm focused on my engineering career and becoming proficient in
      English. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Engineering at Universidad
      Tecnol√≥gica Nacional. Driven by a passion for creating innovative projects, I
      eagerly seek new and exciting opportunities to contribute my skills.

      As a teenager, I used to teach maths to my classmates and other kids in my city, and
      help them with homework and preparing for tests. (continue...)
